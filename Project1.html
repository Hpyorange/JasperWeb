          <p class="text">This UI/UX Study Case is a team project. We chose this website because we thought that it is a
            good representation of most family doctors' websites. The website had not been updated in a while and there
            were a bunch of known user pain points which needed to be addressed. Our goal was to improve the user
            experience, modernise the aesthetic, and provide better access to the medical services.<br><br>My role is
            UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer.</p>

            receiving feedback from past tests, then coded the final product.

          He calls the doctor's office and is placed on hold by the receptionists. He is patiently waiting on hold but
          can no longer remain as his boss is looking for him.
          <br><br>
          He later checks to see if his doctor has a website and is pleasantly surprised that you can book appointments
          online.

          Finally, Fred has made his appointment and can begin his healthy lifestyle journey!

        <p class="text">After analyzing the feedback, We made serval iterations to the prototype. For example, the
          negative feedback mentioned above is a user flow error. To solve that, we removed the unnecessary step to
          create a direct connection between the login page and the appointment system.</p>

        <p class="text">Initially, the home screen had just one hero image, but users thought it would be better to have
          more information. So, we added more informative hero images with call-to-action buttons to make users'
          navigation easy. </p>

          flow from the prototype and create an app for family doctors and patient interaction.
