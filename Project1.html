          <p class="text">This UI/UX Study Case is a team project. We chose this website because we thought that it is a good representation of most family doctors' websites. The website had not been updated in a while and there were a bunch of known user pain points which needed to be addressed. Our goal was to improve the user experience, modernise the aesthetic, and provide better access to the medical services.<br><br>My role is UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer.</p>

            For the <span class="phase1">Discover Phase</span>, we did brainstorming, reviewed the original design then interviewed the stakeholder to get deeper insights.

            The <span class="phase2">Define Phase</span> consisted of making the problem statement and gathering the user insights.
            <br><br>
            In the <span class="phase3">Development Phase</span>, we brainstormed again to check if we were in line with the user's needs. 
            <br><br>
            In the <span class="phase4">Delivery Phase</span>, we made high fidelity prototypes and iterated after receiving feedback from past tests, then coded the final product.</p>

          <p class="text">Frist, we conducted the heuristic evaluation and found lots of visual problems including alignment problems, inconsistent designs, and unorganized footer. Moreover, we also discovered several borken links. The problematic website could make the users feel the clinic might be unprofessional and untrustworthy. </p>

        Overall the results played a big role in prioritizing the features and functionality that later we added to our design.

            He calls the doctor's office and is placed on hold by the receptionists.  He is patiently waiting on hold but can no longer remain as his boss is looking for him.  
            <br><br>
            He later checks to see if his doctor has a website and is pleasantly surprised that you can book appointments online.
